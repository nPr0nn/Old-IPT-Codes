### IPT Physics Projects (2022–2023)

A collection of rough, old code from my participation in the **International Physicists’ Tournament (IPT)** in 2022 and 2023. Most of this was written under tight deadlines, so expect hacky implementations and messy structures.

#### Projects

* **2D Halo** — Simple geometry visualization of shiny scratches in glass and how they redirect light.
* **Airbounce** — Physics simulation of a flying frisbee, including lift, drag, and spin dynamics.
* **Bright Spot** — Light behavior when passing through small holes of different shapes (e.g., diffraction and spot patterns).
* **Smar Water** — Python tool to compare real-life soap film photos with outputs from GeoSteiner (no simulation, just visual matching).
* **Sparkler** — Basic simulation of flying sparks from a party sparkler, using random walk and decay.

> ⚠️ Code quality is pretty awful — rushed for deadlines and experiments. Might clean it up someday… maybe.
